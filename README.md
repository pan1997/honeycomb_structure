# honeycomb_structure
A simple library to produce a 3D structure of a honeycomb weaving pattern using THREE.js
The parameters of the structure can be adjusted from the file honeycomb.js and after that, just open honeycomb.html in any borwser.
Then execute objcreater.sh to get the final obj file.

This project was created for helping a friend in his bachelors thesis, and thus might be a little ad hoc.
